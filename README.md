## Introduction

This application aims to provide a user-friendly platform for managing stock portfolios and trading. It leverages modern web technologies like Next.js for server-side rendering and performance, Redux for predictable state management, and CSS Modules for maintainable styling.

## Features

* **User Authentication:** Secure login and signup functionality.
* **Market Data Display:** Real-time or near real-time stock quotes, charts, and news.
* **Trading Functionality:** Buy and sell orders with order confirmation.
* **Portfolio Management:** View current holdings, transaction history, and portfolio performance.
* **Watchlist:** Add stocks to a watchlist for easy tracking.
* **Responsive Design:** Accessible on various devices.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:**
    * Next.js: React framework for server-side rendering and routing.
    * React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    * Redux (@reduxjs/toolkit, next-redux-wrapper): State management.
    * CSS Modules: Component-scoped styling.
    * Axios: HTTP client for making API requests.
    * Jest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom: Testing framework.
    * [Charting Library - e.g., Recharts, Chart.js]: For interactive charts.
    * [UI Component Library - e.g., Material UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI] (Optional): For pre-built UI components.
    * [WebSocket Library - e.g., socket.io-client] (If real-time data is implemented): For real-time communication.

* **Backend:** (This README focuses on the frontend.  Describe your backend tech stack here.)
    * [Backend Language/Framework - e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Django, Java/Spring Boot]
    * [Database - e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB]
    * [Cloud Platform - e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure] (If applicable)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
* A running backend API (details below).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository URL]
   cd stock-broking-app
2. Install dependencies:
Bash

npm install

## Running the Development Server
* Bash

* npm run dev
* This will start the development server on port 3000 (or as configured).  Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

## Testing
Run unit tests using Jest:

* Bash

* npm run test

## API Integration
The frontend interacts with a backend API to fetch market data, handle authentication, and process trades.  The API endpoints are documented separately (provide a link or reference).  axios is used to make API requests.  Environment variables (e.g., NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL) are used to configure the API base URL.

## Key Considerations
Real-time Data: If real-time updates are required, implement WebSockets using a library like socket.io-client.
Security: Secure your API and protect user data. Follow security best practices.
Performance Optimization: Optimize for performance, especially when dealing with large datasets or frequent updates.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling throughout the application.
